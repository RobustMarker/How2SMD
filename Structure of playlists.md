3 different playlists, 
each with how2smd in the title but each one will be different part for ex:

How2SMD - Reworking
    Video 1 introduction to SMD Reworking

How2SMD - Troubleshooting
    Video 1 understanding circuits 
    Video 2 akmsdakmsd

How2SMD - Designing
    Video 1 blablabla



Video naming scheme:

Video 1 (title) - Quicker and easier to read if looking for a video in playlist but not as descriptive

(title) Ep1 - More descriptive title and possibly easier to find if you know what you were looking for earlier

(title) - raw doggin the name as viewers dont know what episode they are watching but looks "cleaner"
