Hi, welcome to my introductiory series of videos on how to work with surface mount componennts.
Through these sereies of videos ill be talking about and hopefully teaching something new to people.

!#be consistent with abbreviations or mention in the start of the video.

This specific playlist is about how to rework surface mount componnents, reworking involves removing and attaching components on to printed circuit board via heat (well most of the time) 
!#maybe mention apples electronic removable adhesive 

I will be talking about everything from the ground up so it is easy for beginners to understand and get started fixing stuff. So if you are already experienced or knowledgeable with SMD reworking please skip ahead to a video further down the playlist. 

From now on I will be using a lot of abbreviations such as SMD and PCB; since its quicker to say and saves time. Ill try to put captions for the all videos to make it easier to understand and if not ill have all my scripts, sources and whatnot linked in a github repository for people to access.
