first talk about if its even needed to do smd rework, often just replacing a flex cable or component is quicker and sometimes cheaper than reworking

Intro to why components are soldered in the first place, the advantages and disadvantages of having stuff soldered vs in a socket - research this

Mention prerequisites such as rework station, flux, solder etc. It doesnt have to be expensive, it can very quickly get expensive but I started with cheap stuff.  !!ALSO MENTION HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO KEEP STUFF CLEAN AND USE FLUX!!


Talk about practicing first to be confident, try taking apart a broken piece of electronics. Mention to try and keep it smaller to avoid heatsoak, eg motherboards are great as they have a varitey of components but can be hard to heat up with a weaker iron or without a board heater.
